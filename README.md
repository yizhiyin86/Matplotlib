# Matplotlib
Homework for Matplotlib

Pymaceuticals directory has the following items:
  Pymaceuticals.ipynb (jupyter notebook with all the codes and major conclusions as comments)
  Pymaceuticals_md directory with Pymaceuticals.md and images
  conclusions.txt 
  Pymaceuticals_Example.pdf 

Essentially you only need Pymaceuticals.ipynb for grading.
